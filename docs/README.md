## Project Documentation

Hopefully you will find that the project documentation is vast and answers most if not all of your questions. A key
directive of the next-generation application is to reduce barrier to entry as much as possible within reason. To
accomplish this goal, the project has provided great documentation surrounding the common topics of use such as
application configuration, deployment, testing, and planning.
