This release primarily addresses new issues that were brought about with the `0.4.0` release last month such as issues with session expiration and OAuth functionality. Additionally, this release provides some enhancements to existing features such as the authentication settings editor.

Hopefully, this release will provide some stability to the recent OAuth issues that have been popping up since the release of `0.4.0`. I have updated the OAuth providers to make exclusive use of either the metadata URL setting OR the token and authorize URL settings. The UI has been updated in such a way that this change becomes much more obvious. I have personally tested the GitHub and Azure OAuth implementations for basic authentication (not including the additional provider specific features) and can assure that it is functioning with the most basic use cases. It was also discovered that logout was failing for the Azure (and possibly OIDC) providers as the session tokens were not being properly cleared. This would result in an instant re-authentication after logging out due to the tokens still be present in the session.

In general, the authentication settings editor should be a much more enjoyable experience as I pulled out all of the existing client-side code that was a mess and implemented the KnockoutJS and jQuery Validation libraries to improve the UI and UX here. The tabs now provide proper deep-linking so browser history / navigation works very well when changing from tab to tab. One can also reload the page without starting back at the first tab every time. Furthermore, data is both loaded and saved with XHR calls instead of full page loads. This change facilitate the ability to switch to a single save button for all tabs of the editor as opposed to the independent forms that were previously present.
