Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a brief but important announcement with the community. The project's associated Docker Hub repository has changed to a more permanent location to reflect the organization's branding and ongoing future efforts.

The Docker Hub repository for the current PDA application is now located here: https://hub.docker.com/r/powerdnsadmin/pda-legacy

This means that all legacy references to "ngoduykhanh/powerdns-admin" should be changed to "powerdnsadmin/pda-legacy" to continue receiving updates for images.

It's important to take notice that all previous official releases **have NOT been been transferred** to this Docker Hub repository at the time of this post. I will continue working on a solution to get all of the previous releases built and published to the new repository as soon as possible. In the mean time, the best solution if you're using an image from a specific release, would be to continue using the old references until a further announcement has been made for this. The old repository should remain for quite some time until the transition is complete.

Thank you all again for being loyal users of the PDA project!
