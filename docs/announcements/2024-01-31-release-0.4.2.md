This release focused on tying up what loose ends could be within reason in preparation for the freeze release. Following this release, only dependency updates within reason will be managed. There may be additional feature releases on this edition, but nothing is promised.

**POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE** - This release upgrades to SQLAlchemy `1.4.x` which removes support for the use of `postgres://` on database connection URI strings. You must switch to the supported format of `postgresql://` to avoid a failure of the connection.
