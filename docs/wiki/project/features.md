## Project Features

The purpose of this document is to provide some explanation about key platform features that really drive the value of
the product.

### Authentication

The application will ultimately support numerous authentication mechanisms to adhere to the new key mission driver of
reducing barrier to entry. One key enhancement that will be provided is the ability to configure required combinations
of mechanisms in order to gain access to application features. A common example of this would be a credential based
authentication mechanism paired with an SMS or OTP generator option. The purpose of this feature is to allow
administrators to easily construct their own 2nd factor authentication scheme based on the mechanisms supported
internally.

Another key design goal will be to implement a form of pluggable interfaces to each of the service provider based
mechanisms listed below. The purpose of this approach would be to ultimately provide a basic framework for
implementing future service providers in a proficient manner.

Below, you will find a brief explanation of each authentication mechanism which support is
being planned for at some point.

#### Local

As is typical for most applications, local authentication will be provided as the default mechanism unless configured
otherwise.

#### LDAP

The list of service providers below will be initially supported.

Supported Providers:
- Authentik
- Microsoft Active Directory
- OpenLDAP

#### OAuth

The list of service providers below will be initially supported.

Supported Providers:
- Authentik
- Google
- Github
- Microsoft
- OpenID Connect

#### SAML

Some level of focused integration will be provided to the SAML IdP service providers listed below.

Supported Providers:
- Authentik
- AWS IAM
- Google Cloud Identity
- Microsoft Azure AD

#### SMS / Voice

At least a few SMS / Voice providers will be supported to get things started. The general capabilities a provider
must support to be included are programmable SMS and voice capabilities.

Supported Providers:
- AWS
- Twilio
- Telnyx

#### OTP

At least a few options will ultimately be provided to support the use of token generator hardware devices as a method
of authentication to the application.

Supported Providers:
- SafeID?
- Yubico OTP
- OATH-HOTP
- OATH-TOTP

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

This is where this next-gen solution really shines. Taking inspiration from the Amazon Web Service (AWS)
[Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) strategy, a
very granular access control system will be achieved.

The idea starts with the concept of giving all application entities a unique but uniform reference format similar to
AWS ARN except known as "PDARN". Here is how that reference is structured:

> pdarn:tenant-id:app-id:resource-type:resource-id:permission-flags

The idea is to provide a reference structure that can target any unique, mutable data point of the application. By
doing this, an administrator can create access control policies that can target just about any user manageable
reference in the application, thus achieving extreme granularity on the RBAC system. This is further complimented by
the fact that this approach should be somewhat friendly to third-party authentication integrations such as LDAP and
OAUTH as examples.

The various app components within the API server application will use a structured definition system that allows for
each app to provide references to PDARN patterns provided by that app as well as what permissions are available for
each PDARN pattern. This essentially makes the RBAC pluggable for new developments as defining new capabilities in app
components becomes very easy and fast. This approach also makes supporting completely fluid permissions structures
possible.

#### Examples

In practice, here is what some PDARNs would look like:

**Tenant Level Reference**

This reference targets the tenant account with an ID of "4321" and references the creation, read, update, and delete
permissions for this entity.

> pdarn:4321:c,r,u,d

**Tenant Settings Reference**

This reference targets the tenant account settings app for tenant "4321" and references all available permissions for
this entity.

> pdarn:4321:settings

**More Specific Tenant Settings Reference**

This reference targets the "auth" area of the settings app for tenant "4321" and references the read permission for the
entity.

> pdarn:4321:settings/sync:r

**Specific Setting Reference**

This reference targets the "ui/web" area of the settings app for tenant "4321" and references the update permission for
the entity.

> pdarn:4321:settings/ui/web:site-title:u

**Specific Zone Record Reference**

This reference targets a specific record set record with the ID "123" for the TXT record set of "example.com" within the
tenant "4321" and references the dynamic DNS update permission for the entity.

> pdarn:4321:zones/example.com/txt/@:123:ddu

**Specific Zone Record Set Reference**

This reference targets the A record set for "stage.example.com" within the tenant "4321" and references the read
permission for the entity.

> pdarn:4321:zones/example.com/a:stage:r
