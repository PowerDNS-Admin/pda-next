### Labeling Standards

It's important to recognize the value of proper labeling for issues and discussions when a project operates at scale.
Without this organization, it makes for extra workload on the project maintainers as it requires a detailed review of
each unlabeled issue to set in motion any further workflows, both automated and manual.

Please consider all the following when creating new issues or discussions. If an issue or discussion isn't properly
labeled per the following standards, it may result in notable delays before a project maintainer addresses the issue or
discussion.
